Twin Maze
=========

This is my secondary entry for [SMS Power's 2016 competition][SMSPower-2016].

I originally intended to make a simultaneous two player first person maze game, with competitive modes (deathmatch and race) and cooperative modes (vs monsters).
Due to time constraints, though, it is, for now, more of an unoptimized tech demo where two players can explore a maze simultaneously. There's currently no other objectives other than that.
